- **price_per_night**: Nightly rental rate
- **max_guests**: Maximum number of guests allowed
- **amenities**: JSON field listing available amenities
- **availability_status**: Current availability status
- **created_at**: Listing creation timestamp

#### 3. Bookings
Represents reservation transactions between guests and properties.

- **created_at**: Booking creation timestamp

#### 4. Reviews
Represents feedback and ratings from guests about properties and hosts.
- **review_id**: Unique identifier (Primary Key)
- **booking_id**: Foreign key referencing Bookings table
- **reviewer_id**: Foreign key referencing Users table
- **rating**: Numerical rating (1-5 stars)

### Entity Relationships

- **Users → Properties**: One-to-Many (A user can host multiple properties)
